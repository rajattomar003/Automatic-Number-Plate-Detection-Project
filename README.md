## Overview

This project is aimed at developing a system for Automatic Number Plate Detection (ANPR) using computer vision and machine learning techniques. ANPR is a technology that uses optical character recognition to automatically read license plates on vehicles. This project can be useful for various applications, including traffic monitoring, parking management, and security.

## Features

- Detect and extract license plates from images.
- Perform optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from the detected plates.
- Support for real-time processing.
- User-friendly and easy-to-configure.
